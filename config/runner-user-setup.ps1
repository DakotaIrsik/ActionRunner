# GitHub Actions Runner - Secure Service Account Setup
# This script creates a dedicated Windows user account with minimal permissions for running the GitHub Actions runner service

#Requires -RunAsAdministrator

<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Creates a secure, limited-privilege user account for GitHub Actions runner service.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script implements security best practices by creating a dedicated service account
    with minimal permissions required to run the GitHub Actions runner. This follows the
    principle of least privilege to limit potential damage from compromised workflows.

.PARAMETER Username
    The username for the runner service account. Default: "GitHubRunner"

.PARAMETER RunnerPath
    The path where the runner is installed. Default: "C:\actions-runner"

.EXAMPLE
    .\runner-user-setup.ps1
    Creates the default GitHubRunner account

.EXAMPLE
    .\runner-user-setup.ps1 -Username "GHRunner" -RunnerPath "D:\runner"
    Creates a custom account with specified runner path

.NOTES
    - Requires Administrator privileges
    - Password is randomly generated and must be stored securely
    - Follow your organization's password management policies

IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES:
1. Store this password in a secure password manager (e.g., 1Password, LastPass, Azure Key Vault)
2. DELETE this file after storing the password securely
3. Never commit this file to version control
4. Rotate this password every 90 days per security policy
5. This account should only be used for the GitHub Actions Runner service

Created: $(Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss")

Next Steps:
1. Store password in password manager
2. Delete this file: Remove-Item "$outputFile"
3. Configure the runner: .\config.cmd
4. Test the runner service
